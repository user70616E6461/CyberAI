# 🤖 CyberAI

**Offensive testing for MCP servers and LLM agents — runtime, not metadata**

> Blind findings proven out-of-band, not inferred from response diffs.
> Built by someone who red-teams AI, not just with it.

![CyberAI benchmark demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evkir/CyberAI/main/docs/assets/demo-bench.gif)

*Recorded run of the fixed probes against four vulnerable targets in Docker — pass@1 4/4, which says the targets and the harness work. The pipeline itself scores the same suite 4/4 in 21 requests; both cards are linked below. The fourth target is blind: it counts as solved only when a collector we control records the callback. Reproduce with `cyberai bench run --suite local --engine real`.*

## What is CyberAI?

CyberAI is a multi-agent orchestration layer for offensive security. Eight
specialized agents run a typed, auditable pipeline that turns a target into
actionable attack paths and a validated report. Four of them — **Recon,
Intel, Exploit, Report** — form the network chain; **Web3**, **MCP Scan** and
**Redteam** take their own kinds of target, and **Planner** orders the work
the others do. The table below says what each one takes and produces.

Two things set it apart from "LLM wrapper over nmap":

- **OOB-driven exploitation.** Blind vulns (SSRF, XXE, blind injection) are
  confirmed through out-of-band callbacks captured by
  [phantom-grid](https://github.com/evkir/phantom-grid), not guessed from
  response diffs.
- **Agent-trust-aware design.** Every message on its way to a model passes one
  guard, which labels or blocks what scores as an injection before the
  provider is contacted; each phase's output is separately scanned and a hit
  becomes a MEDIUM finding. Adversarial thinking is a design input, not a
  disclaimer — the gaps are named in
  [docs/security/adversarial-robustness.md](docs/security/adversarial-robustness.md).

Reach beyond the network: the **Web3 agent** runs Slither static analysis and
maps detectors to Immunefi severity tiers for smart-contract audits.

**In one sentence:** an offensive AI-supply-chain red-team platform — it attacks
MCP servers and LLM/RAG endpoints, proves blind vulnerabilities out-of-band,
audits Web3 contracts on-chain, and publishes reproducible benchmarks, with a
fully air-gapped path on local models (Ollama/vLLM).

Real orchestrator output (trust-aware pipeline in action):

```text
⚠ injection signals in recon output (risk=25)
[ExploitAgent] Generating OOB payloads...
[ExploitAgent] Polling phantom-grid...
[exploit] OOB callbacks: 1
```


## Quick Start

```bash
pip install cyberai

# dry-run: full pipeline, no real network calls
cyberai scan example.com --dry-run

# real scan with a local model (air-gapped, no cloud) and scope
cyberai scan app.target.com --provider ollama --scope "*.target.com"

cyberai status          # provider, output, trust boundary, sampling, air-gap, credentials, toolchain
cyberai replay <id>     # re-run a saved session
```

**See it on a real target:** a full run against OWASP Juice Shop, committed
exactly as produced — 14 endpoints found, 13 walked, one SQL injection proven
by the database error it returned, and the local model's reading of all of it,
including the 15 parameters that ignored every payload and the 10 that
refused the caller outright:
[examples/juice-shop/](examples/juice-shop/)

**Trust-aware in one sentence:** a malicious banner crafted to hijack the model
is wrapped as untrusted where it is stored, and if it ever reaches a prompt the
guard in front of the provider labels, redacts or blocks it — under `deny`, no
request is made at all. Recon and intel contact no model, so a banner from those
phases reaches one only by way of the report.

## Security design

- **One trust boundary in front of the model** — `TrustGuard.inspect()` sits
  inside `LLMClient`, ahead of the provider branch, on all four entry points.
  Nothing reaches OpenAI, Anthropic or Ollama without passing it. It scores
  the raw message and sanitises the copy it sends: the reverse order was
  measured to blind the detector, because sanitisation strips three of the
  categories the detector scores on, so a payload carrying a template marker
  scored *lower* through the guard than raw. System prompts are never
  rewritten — only user, tool and function messages are attacker-reachable.
- **Three policies, one variable** — `CYBERAI_INJECTION_POLICY` selects
  `annotate` (default: label the content as untrusted, send it, record the
  verdict), `quarantine` (label, replace each match with
  `[REDACTED:<category>]`, cap the length), or `deny` (raise; the provider is
  never contacted). Pick `annotate` when a false positive must not corrupt
  legitimate input, `deny` for an engagement where a suspected injection
  should stop the run. `quarantine` is not the default on purpose: it mutates
  content, and the detector it would run on has no published precision. The
  figure behind that choice — 42 flagged of 43 real scan reports — was taken
  on a corpus that is not tracked in this repository and no longer exists. It
  is kept in `core/security/guard.py` as the recorded reason for the default,
  not as a reproducible measurement. `quarantine` becomes the default when W3
  publishes precision and recall on a tracked corpus.
- **Every verdict is in the audit trail** — policy, threshold, score,
  categories and how many messages were modified, written per call. Message
  bodies stay out of it.
- **Prompt-injection detection** — 33 patterns across 10 weighted categories,
  measured rather than described. On the tracked corpus the pattern layer
  scores 62.7% recall at 100.0% precision with a 0.0% false-positive rate,
  and it is blind to three injection subclasses: multilingual, paraphrase,
  social. The optional local-model layer takes recall to 98.0% with the
  false-positive rate unchanged. Neither number is typed by hand — both come
  out of `cyberai detector eval --corpus tests/corpus`, the second with
  `--l2-replay examples/detector-eval/l2-verdicts.json`, and a test fails if
  this paragraph and that command disagree. Also run
  on each phase's *output*, where a hit becomes a MEDIUM finding. That pass
  is an audit signal, not a barrier: it runs after the agent has already
  called the model, and it is labelled as such in the code and the report.
  The barrier is the guard above.
- **Scope enforcement** — wildcard + `!`-exclusion matching honors HackerOne /
  Bugcrowd briefs (`cyberai scope import`).
- **Audit trail** — every agent action logged to JSONL with full
  inputs/outputs; sessions are replayable. Every line is HMAC-signed —
  `cyberai audit-verify <file>` reports any line edited after the run.

MITRE-ATLAS red-team report. See
[docs/redteam/mcp-scanning.md](docs/redteam/mcp-scanning.md).

---

## Configuration

```yaml
# config.yml
llm:
  provider: openai        # openai | anthropic
  model: gpt-4o
  max_tokens: 4096
  temperature: 0.2

phantom:
  grid_url: http://127.0.0.1:9090

output_dir: reports/
max_cost_usd: 0.0         # 0 = disabled; set to enforce a budget

### Environment variables

Every setting can be driven from the environment (or a `.env` file - see
[.env.example](.env.example)). Feature flags are off by default
(no-regression); enable any with `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `CYBERAI_LLM_PROVIDER` / `CYBERAI_MODEL` | LLM provider and model |
| `CYBERAI_USE_BEHAVIORAL` | Honeypot/WAF/tarpit fingerprinting in recon |
| `CYBERAI_USE_PORT_FINGERPRINT` | Banner grab on ports nmap could not name |
| `CYBERAI_USE_NUCLEI` | Nuclei template exploit engine |
| `CYBERAI_USE_JUDGE` | LLM-as-Judge report validation |
| `CYBERAI_ENABLE_REPLAN` | Critic-driven phase replan |
| `CYBERAI_USE_EXPLOIT_MEMORY` | Recall similar past exploit chains |
| `CYBERAI_AIR_GAPPED` | Force local-only (no-egress) LLM path |
| `CYBERAI_STRICT_SCOPE` | Refuse the exploit phase when no scope was given |
| `CYBERAI_ENABLE_MODEL_ROUTING` | Per-phase model selection |
| `CYBERAI_MAX_COST_USD` | LLM spend budget (0 = disabled) |
| `CYBERAI_OUTPUT_DIR` | Report output directory |
| `CYBERAI_SESSION_SECRET` | Audit-trail signing key; unset means a published fallback |

The `scan` command overrides the main flags per run, in either direction:

```bash
cyberai scan example.com --behavioral --nuclei
cyberai scan example.com --no-air-gapped
```


---

## Benchmarks — honest numbers

CyberAI measures its own engine against a small, self-contained suite of
deliberately-vulnerable targets it authors and serves — no third-party
benchmark required to reproduce the numbers.

```bash
cyberai bench list
cyberai bench run --suite local --engine agent --scorecard reports/scorecard-agent.md
cyberai bench run --suite local --engine real  --scorecard reports/scorecard.md
```

Every published number is **reproducible** (targets ship in `cyberai/bench/apps/`),
**binary** (solved only on an unambiguous success signal from a responding
target — never "looks exploited"), and **traceable** (each run emits a scorecard
with engine version, provider, model, timestamp).

Latest run of the local suite (CyberAI 1.6.0, 2026-08-26), scored twice — once by the pipeline that is the product, once by the fixed probes. Both reach 4/4:

| vuln class | solved | total | rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sqli | 1 | 1 | 100% |
| command_injection | 1 | 1 | 100% |
| path_traversal | 1 | 1 | 100% |
| ssrf | 1 | 1 | 100% |
| **pass@1** | **4** | **4** | **100%** |

What the pipeline spent reaching that score. The probes produce none of these
numbers, which is why the card beside this one has no metrics section:

| task id | in-band | out of band | endpoints | requests |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| local-sqli-login | 2 | 0 | 1 | 5 |
| local-cmdi-ping | 1 | 0 | 1 | 3 |
| local-path-traversal | 1 | 0 | 1 | 3 |
| local-ssrf-fetch | 0 | 1 | 1 | 10 |
| **total** | **4** | **1** | **4** | **21** |

Two engines, one suite, answering different questions. `--engine real` drives
fixed per-class probes: 4/4 there means the targets are exploitable and the
harness works — it measures the bench, not the product. `--engine agent`
drives the full pipeline, which is handed an address and has to discover the
surface before it can attack it; 4/4 there is the product finding and proving
four flaws on its own. The second is the number worth publishing, and it is
the one above.

Read the zero honestly: **the pipeline reaches 4/4 without contacting a
model.** The agent engine constructs no LLM client on this path, and the card
records that rather than implying it — `llm calls 0`, `llm zero reason
engine_uses_no_model`, a proven zero instead of a blank nobody counted.
Discovery, payload selection and proof are code here, not inference. The
model earns its place elsewhere: reading a surface larger than four
endpoints, the analysis and the report. Publishing this suite as evidence of
a language model solving CTFs would be the easy lie — it solved them with no
model at all.

In-band and out-of-band are counted apart because of the blind SSRF target:
it answers identically whichever way the fetch goes, so it is proven by a
callback carrying the run nonce, and folding that into the in-band column
would print a zero on a task that was solved.

Read the suite honestly too: it is **authored by the project it measures**.
It proves the engine works end-to-end against live targets in Docker and
guards against regression between releases — it is not a competitive result
and is not comparable to CVE-Bench or CyBench. The one external suite run so
far, CVE-Bench, scored 0/3 on three selected tasks; the runs and the reason
are in [docs/benchmarks/cve-bench.md](docs/benchmarks/cve-bench.md).

Part of an earlier 4/4 was self-referential — the exploitation engine held a
literal from a target this project wrote. What was wrong, what changed and
what the numbers did afterwards is written up in
[docs/benchmarks/contamination-2026-08.md](docs/benchmarks/contamination-2026-08.md).

Both cards are committed:
[scorecard-agent.md](examples/local-bench/scorecard-agent.md) for the
pipeline, [scorecard.md](examples/local-bench/scorecard.md) for the probes.
The run manifest is not, and `--manifest <path>` reproduces it.

The default `--engine placeholder` reports all-unsolved by design so a scorecard
never overstates capability; `--engine real` runs live per-class probes. External
suites (CVE-Bench, CyBench, EVMBench) plug into the same `BenchTask` contract as
optional adapters for leaderboard parity — never as a product dependency.

See [docs/benchmarks/local-suite.md](docs/benchmarks/local-suite.md) for the
methodology and the current scorecard.
