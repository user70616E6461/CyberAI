"""The typing badge must state the size of what the type checker actually reads.

The badge once said `mypy core typed` while `[tool.mypy] files` held one module
of 136 lines. The CI job was real, green and honest about its own scope; the
badge generalised it to a package with hundreds of errors in it. A green
instrument pointed at one file is worse than a missing one, because it looks
like evidence.

The first version of this gate compared the set of paths named in the badge
against the set of paths in `files`. That contract holds only while the scope
is small enough to spell out. It is replaced by a counted one: the badge names
how many modules the checker reads and how many the package contains. A
directory in `files` is expanded, so adding a module to a checked directory
moves the count and the badge has to follow. The scope is resolved as a set,
so an entry that overlaps a directory already listed cannot inflate the
numerator.

The rule stays bidirectional. Widening the scope without touching the badge
understates the guarantee and fails here; claiming a wider scope than `files`
resolves to overstates it and fails here too.

Counting used to live in this file, which left the ratio readable and
unwritable. It now lives in scripts/mypy_badge.py and this file reads it, so
the numbers written and the numbers checked come from one pair of functions.
The script is loaded by path: scripts/ resolves today only because of how the
package is installed, and a gate resting on the install mode is a gate about
one machine.
