"""The coverage upload has to be a measurement, not a hopeful POST.

Every pull request carried a banner asking for the Codecov app to be
installed, which is what an unauthenticated upload looks like from the other
end. The upload was also configured not to fail the job, so an upload that
never arrived produced no status, no comment and no red -- the exact shape of
a check that decides nothing, which codecov.yml already argues against in
prose.

Two things fix it and only one of them lives here. Authenticating the upload
does, and there are two means of doing it: an OIDC token minted from the
workflow's own identity, the way release.yml publishes to PyPI, or an upload
token kept as a repository secret. Installing the Codecov GitHub App does not
-- it is an account-level setting, it cannot be asserted from a checkout, and
the note is here because this is where the next person looks.

Which of the two means is in use right now is an experiment rather than a
preference. OIDC was chosen in day 29 and nothing has been found wrong with
it. What is wrong is downstream: the head commit of every pull request is
recorded on branch main although --branch is sent, and codecov/project has
arrived on none of them. How the upload authenticates is the one difference
between this repository and a working one that has not been varied, so the
token path is run once to separate "the OIDC path loses the branch" from
"the service ignores what the client sent". A correctly recorded branch under
a token puts the answer here; an incorrectly recorded one puts it with the
service, and the facts are then complete enough to file. OIDC returns either
way unless the token is what makes the status arrive.

fail_ci_if_error is on deliberately. It means a Codecov outage reds this job
and, with the required checks on main, blocks merges until it clears. That is
the cost of the upload being load-bearing; the alternative is the state this
repository was already in, where the report was optional and therefore
ignored.

An authenticated upload can still be filed against the wrong commit. The
uploads were arriving and being accepted for a month while codecov/project
never appeared. The checkout depth was offered as the reason and was not it:
depth zero landed in day 32 and the next commit still had patch and no
project. The depth is still asserted below, because a full fetch is what
Codecov documents and that is true regardless of which guess was right.

What is measured about the missing status, and what was withdrawn: this
paragraph used to report pullid, head and compared_to as null. The Codecov
API has no such fields, so those were .get() calls on absent keys rather than
readings, and the conclusion drawn from them -- that project had no base and
so had nothing to send -- goes with them. What survives being asked with keys
that exist: codecov knows every branch by name, the uploader sends --pr and
--branch, the commit is still recorded on branch main, and the pull request
carries both base and head totals, so a base is there. patch is computed from
the diff with the parent and arrives as a check-run. Across the heads of pull
requests 258 to 267 patch appears from 261 onwards and project appears on
none of the ten, so nothing regressed here; the status has never arrived at
all. The uploader is told which pull request and which branch it is on
because that is the right thing to send, not because it produced the status.

What that costs, and what of it is measured: neither means of authenticating
survives a fork. A workflow triggered by a pull request from a fork is
granted neither id-token: write nor the repository secrets, so under either
means the upload has nothing to present and the job reds on a contribution
the contributor cannot fix. That much follows from the permissions model.

What was measured, on the day this paragraph stopped guessing: all 267 pull
requests this repository has ever had were opened from branches inside it,
and the two existing forks have opened none. So the failure has never
happened, and saying it has not is now a count rather than an impression.

The fork-aware condition this paragraph used to promise is not free: an `if`
on the upload step is exactly what the sibling test above reds on, because it
would end the one-upload-per-matrix-entry arrangement described there. Until
a fork actually opens one, the cheaper half is done instead -- CONTRIBUTING
tells the contributor what a red upload on their pull request means and that
it is not their contribution being refused, which is asserted below so the
warning cannot quietly go missing while the upload stays credentialed.
