"""The typing scope has an edge, and until now nothing said where.

`[tool.mypy] files` names 95 modules and the run reports `Success` on exactly
95, which reads like a guarantee about those modules and is one only up to
the boundary. Nineteen of them import a module outside the scope at module
level. mypy follows such an import to resolve the name and stays silent about
what it finds: appending an unannotated function to `cyberai/core/config.py`,
which is outside the scope and imported from inside it, changed nothing about
the output on a cold cache. A name crossing the edge is therefore typed by a
module nothing checks.

That is a fact about the shape of the codebase, not a defect to repair, and
this file does not ask for it to shrink. It asks for it to be known. The two
counts move when an import is added or removed across the edge, and moving
them reds here, so the paragraph in docs/architecture/typing-scope.md gets
rewritten by whoever moved them rather than by whoever notices years later.

The counts are deliberately not derived from the doc. Reading them out of the
prose they exist to check would make this test agree with itself.
